The code houses the metadigitized scatterplot data for compiling time series from studies that have discussed boom-bust as per the search terms from Strayer et al., 2017. In addition to these search terms, it includes time series from other reviews that have used boom-bust studies. It then includes some simple summary statistics for the compiled list of time-series, filters the list by metrics like timeseries length, and time series completeness, implements regime shift analysis, then applies the definition of a boom-bust presented by this paper, and peforms some other simple summary statistics for the final list of identified boom-bust studies. The code is housed in the folder labled "rscripts", the data are housed in the folder labeled "data", the photos of the varius compiled time series are housed in the folder labeled "TimeSeriesPictures_Literature/TimeSeriesFigures", the various version of the manuscript are housed in the "ms" folder, and any output associated with the code are housed in the "output" folder.
